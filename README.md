# portable-liIon-battery-pack


This is a small lithium Ion battery pack that I was inspired to create when I could
not find any that would meet my needs. It uses 4x 18650 LiIon cells to create 14.4V.

This project is still in early alpha and is not even remotely ready for use or testing yet.

**WARNING:** Lithium Ion batteries can be extremely dangerous and even deadly.
Please educate yourself on the proper care and feeding of these batteries before
even looking at this project. I will not be held liable for any injuries or deaths
caused due to the use of this product.

**Please do not be stupid**
